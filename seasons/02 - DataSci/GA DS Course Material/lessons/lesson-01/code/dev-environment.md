# Getting Started with Data Science Tools
These items are included in the Data Science prework and are intended to help students prepare for the first day of class.
-       Github Account
-       Installations
-       Syntax Practice

### Accounts
1. [ ] Create a Github account, if you do not already have one.

### Installations
Please follow the installation instructions below.

1. [ ] Install [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        - *Note: Make sure to install version 2.7, NOT Python 3, which has significant differences from 2.7 and is not “industry standard.” We will be using Python 2.7.*

2. [ ] Install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads)
        - Follow the installation instructions for your computer (e.g. Mac Install).
        - Test that Anaconda and Python were installed correctly. For example, on a Mac you can by open a Terminal window (or the Anaconda Launcher app on your desktop) and type `jupyter notebook`. If successful, in a few moments, your browser should open to a window titled "Jupyter."

### Start Practicing
Review the following resources as an introduction to some commonly used concepts and tools.

1. [ ] Complete Codecademy's free ["Learn Python"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/python) course to practice your Python syntax. Pay close attention to lists, dictionaries, and functions.
    - Bonus Option: Check out [Learn Python the Hard  Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/) and work through exercises 1-10.

2. [ ] Review our [Command Line](http://generalassembly.github.io/prework/cl/#/) tutorial to familiarize yourself with basic Terminal commands. Pay particular attention to folder navigation and file creation.
    - Bonus Option: Run through these additional exercises from [Learn Command Line the Hard Way](http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/).

3. [ ] Read through this [10 minute guide to Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) to learn about a popular library used for data analysis that we will be using in this course.
    - Bonus Option: Practice your Python by working through [Project Euler's computational problems](https://projecteuler.net).
