## PROMPT

In the field of data science, projects are practical. A good project is manageable and relates to your working domain; however, it can be hard to filter and scope good ideas when you are new to a field. That is where Part 1 of your final project comes in.

One of the best ways to test expectations and get feedback is to share your ideas with others. For part one of your final project, you will come up with a few different ideas you could potentially solve with data, then present them in small groups to the class.

You will get the opportunity to get immediate feedback and guidance in order to help you choose an awesome final project idea. Keep in mind that it is important to run through this iterative process a few times with different ideas to clarify what your project should focus on.

**Goal**: Prepare a one-minute lightning talk that covers 3 potential project topics.

## DELIVERABLES

### Lightning Presentation

- **Requirements:** You should present from a prepared deck that explains the following:
    - _**The Problem**_: What is the background and scope of the project idea? What problem are you attempting to address or solve? Who may it matter to?
    - _**Data**_: What data exists to help solve this problem? Where is it coming from? What does the data look like? What is the observation?
    - _**Hypothesis**_: Given the problem and data you are aware of, what do you believe is the solution? What does success look like?

- **Detailed Breakdown:** Your presentation must:
    - Explain three potential projects, including a problem statement, a hypothesis, and potential datasets
    - Be 2-3 minutes in duration
    - Demonstrate familiarity with the domain of the data

- **Bonus:**
    - High-level data points can help show the "improvement" scope that is available
    - Cite similar/previous work that will better inform your strategy that can be taken

- **Submission:**
    - Present materials in class
    - Submit presentation to the instructor via email.

## EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Identify the Problem

### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./final-project-1-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you have met project goals, **specific standards scores are more important** since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

## RESOURCES

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Try putting together a three-slide deck for each of your project ideas, in order to stay organised.
- Look for example (or real) data to get a feel for what information exists that you can use.
- Think about how much time you can dedicate to the project each week, and where you think the largest challenges will lie.
- Think about this as an elevator pitch: be prepared, do some light research, but do not go down any "rabbit holes".
