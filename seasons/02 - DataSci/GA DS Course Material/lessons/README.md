## Available Materials

For every lesson, we've supplied a folder full of materials, including the following:

| Materials | Description | How to Use It |
|----|---------|---------------|
| __README.md__| Topic overview and breakdown | Use this to get a high level view, including information on lesson content, in-class activities, objectives, prework and projects |
| __Starter Folder__| Code for demonstrations, code alongs and questions for guided or independent practice | Use this to walk students through code snippets or give students workshops / lab assignments in-class |
| __Solution Folder__| Solutions for guided and independent practice | Use this to assess or walk students through solutions when needed |
| __Datasets__| Dataset used during lesson | Use this during demonstrations/code alongs as well as guided and independent practice activities |

### Folder Navigation
Each lesson folder is organised in the following pattern:

- **Lesson**: includes the root lesson README
  - _Code_
    - **Starter Code**: Jupyter notebook for demonstrations, as well as questions for guided and independent practice
    - **Solution Code**: Jupyter notebook with answers to questions from guided and independent practice
  - _Assets_
    - **Dataset**: Includes or links to the dataset(s) used during demonstration, guided and independent practice
    - **Images**: Includes or links to any images referenced
    - **Slides**: Links to the baseline lesson deck for you to copy and modify

## Lesson Structure

Lesson plans are organised as follows:

1. **YAML Frontmatter**: Content revision log
2. **Learning Objectives**: What students should be able to do after lesson completion
3. **Student Prework**: What students should already know how to do before this lesson
4. **Instructor Prep**: Specific instructions for the instructor
5. **Lesson Guide**: High level timing overview of lesson structure
6. **Lesson Content**: Content is divided into modular, adjustable components by topic:
  - _Opening_: Objectives, QA, Reminders
  - _Topic - Introduction_: Slide deck supported lecture
  - _Topic - Demonstration or Code Along_: Walkthrough
  - _Topic - Guided Practice_: Short practice activity
  - _Topic - Independent Practice_: Summative activity with deliverable(s)
  - _Conclusion_: Lesson and Lab Review, QA, Exit Tickets
7. **Upcoming Assignments**: Homework or Projects
8. **Additional Resources**: Links that you should feel free to add to or supplement
