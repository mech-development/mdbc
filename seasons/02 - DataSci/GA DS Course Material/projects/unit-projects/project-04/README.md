DS | Unit Project 4

## PROMPT

In this project, you will summarise and present your analysis from Projects 1-3. Your goal is to complete your ongoing Jupyter Notebook, combining prior deliverables from projects 1-3 with an appendix and executive summary. This will be a final overview of your analysis that incorporates past feedback and demonstrates your approach.

**Goal:** Write up an executive summary that outlines your findings and the methods used in projects 1-3.

- **Requirements:**
    - "Specific aim"
    - Outlined methods and models
    - Articulation of datasets
    - Risks and assumptions
    - Goals and criteria for success
    - An exploratory data analysis overview with visualisations and statistical analysis
    - A write-up on the interpretation of findings including an executive summary with conclusions and next steps

- **Bonus:**
    - Always consider your audience - what do they already know vs. what should you define or explain?
    - Visualise your findings! Use charts, graphs or other images as appropriate.

- **Submission:**

## EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Present Results
2. Professional Development

### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./project4-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you have met project goals, **specific standards scores are more important** since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

## RESOURCES

### Dataset
We will be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logistic Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python, as explained in [yhat's blog](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/logistic-regression-and-python.html). This is an excellent resource for using logistic regression and summary statistics to explore a relevant dataset. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables `admit`, `gre`, `gpa` and `rank`.

- `admit` is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted `admit=1`) our not (`admit=0`)
- `gre` is GRE score
- `gpa` stands for Grade Point Average
- `rank` is the rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, with 1 being the highest and 4 as the lowest

Dataset: [admissions.csv](../../../data/admissions.csv)

### Starter code
Open the [Jupyter Notebook](./starter/project4-starter.ipynb) and follow the questions provided.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- Review your previous work and any prior instructor feedback
- Look up sample executive summaries online
