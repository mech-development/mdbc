Our projects include objectives, requirements, starter, rubric and suggested resources - all of which tie into the overall competencies for each unit.

## **Unit Project 1**

Students will create a framework to scope out their data science projects, using Jupyter notebook and a UCLA admissions dataset.

This framework will provide you with a guide for exploratory data analysis and help you identify features of the dataset, including the outcome and covariate/predictors. You will develop a well-articulated problem statement and analysis plan that will be robust and reproducible. Using a Jupyter notebook, you will state the risks and assumptions of your data and create a data dictionary.

- **Goal**: Create a problem statement, analysis plan and data dictionary in Jupyter.

## **Unit Project 2**

Building upon the framework you created in Project 1, now you will need to explore your dataset using descriptive statistics and basic visualisations, in order to identify biases, limitations, or variables in your model. This will lay the groundwork for your modelling approach in Project 3.

- **Goal**: Explore data with visualisations and statistical analysis in a Jupyter notebook.

## **Unit Project 3**

Students will put into practice the framework and exploratory analysis created in Projects 1 and 2 by completing a logistic regression model on the UCLA admissions dataset. You will have to create dummy variables and calculate the OR by hand. After plotting the data, your Jupyter notebook writeup should also include calculations of the predicted probabilities and an interpretation of your findings.

- **Goal**: Perform logistic regression on UCLA dataset, creating dummy variables and calculating probabilities.
- **[Detailed Spec File](./project-03/README.md)**

## **Unit Project 4**

Students will polish their Jupyter notebook by combining prior project deliverables into a final, polished Jupyter notebook that begins with an executive summary, states goals and success criteria, outlines methods and aims, describes risks and assumptions, explains modelling approach using visualisations and concludes with findings and next steps.

This project will familiarise students with the role of audience analysis and model defence in real-world data science presentations.

- **Goal**: Present your findings in a Jupyter notebook with an executive summary, visuals and recommendations.
