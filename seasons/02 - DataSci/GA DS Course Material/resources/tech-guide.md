## REQUIRED TOOLS
Before the course starts, you may want to familiarise yourself with the following technologies:

- [**Anaconda**](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) - We will be using Anaconda as our primary development environment.
- [**Python 2.7**](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/) - We will be using Python and its packages as our primary language.
- [**Github**](http://github.com) - We will be using Github on a daily basis to store and share our code.
- [**Git**](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
    - Mac: [**Git Bash**](https://git-for-windows.github.io)
    - PC: You will also need to install Git command line tools for your OS.
- [**Postgres**](http://www.postgresql.org/download/) - We will be using Postgres for local SQL-based data storage.
- [**Tableau**](http://www.tableau.com/) is a popular dashboard creation system for visualising data.
- [**Slack**](http://slack.com) - We will be using Slack on a daily basis to communicate with each other.

## COMMON TOOLS

- Anaconda bundles many of the Python packages we will be using, including:
  - **Python 2.7**: The most widely used, stable, enterprise version of Python.
  - **Ipython / Jupyter** and **Pandas**: Core tools for notebooks and data analysis.
  - **Matplotlib**: The king of all python plotting packages.
  - **Gensim**: Framework for vector modelling.
  - **NLTK** and **Spacy**: Used for natural language processing.
  - **NumPy**: Array processing tool.
  - **Scikit-learn**: Modules for machine learning and data modelling.
  - **SciPy**: Scientific library for python.
  - **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualiser.
  - **Pip** and **Setuptools**: package installer and version manager (Mac only).
  - **PyMC**: common stats tool for simulation and optimisation.
  - **Sqlite**: Standalone, lightweight SQL database engine.
  - **Statsmodels**: Simple statistical computation (used with SciPy).

## ADDITIONAL TOOLS
These tools are not specifically required, but are highly recommended.

- [**Atom**](https://atom.io/) or [**Sublime**](http://www.sublimetext.com/) are popular text editors for writing scripts to process data, perform analysis, and create visualisations.
- [**Chrome**](https://www.google.com/chrome/) is Google's popular web browser, and comes with a complete set of developer tools built-in.
- [**Import.io**](https://www.import.io/): a useful web scraping tool with a graphic interface.
- [**Plot.ly**](https://plot.ly): a user-friendly tool for plotting graphs.

## A NOTE ABOUT TECHNOLOGY
Follow the guidelines below to ensure your machine is fully prepared for Data Science:

### System Requirements
Make sure your machine is running with administrator permissions and has **at least 10+ GB of free disk space**. We also recommend that you use a laptop with a **13-inch screen or larger** in order to do your best work. In our experience, _students with an 11-inch screen have a harder time in class_.

#### Mac Users
General Assembly is a Mac-friendly organisation. Our instructors will be teaching the course using Macs, so we strongly recommend students use a Mac with OS X 10.12 (Sierra) in order to run all of the programs necessary for the course. **This rules out some older MacBooks.**

Check the following specs to make sure your machine can provide you with the performance you will need in this course:

- _1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor_
- _Turbo Boost up to 2.7GHz_
- _Intel HD Graphics 6000_
- _At least 8GB RAM_
- _128GB flash storage_
- _10+ GB of free disk space_

#### PC Users
While you can be a data scientist with _almost any_ machine, some students have found compatibility issues with older versions of Windows. While you can be a data scientist with any machine, unfortunately, there are a number of compatibility issues with Python libraries and older versions of Windows. For example, Python and Anaconda users have identified multiple issues with Windows 7 x64 machines.

Therefore, we **strongly recommend** that PCs users adopt the latest version of Windows (Windows 10). PC users on older machines may consider installing a Virtual Machine like [**Oracle’s Virtualbox**](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) and running Anaconda in a Linux environment via [**Ubuntu Desktop**](http://www.ubuntu.com/download). [**See more information here**](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/images).

Please note that our instructors will be conducting the course using Macs, and _may not be able to help PC or Linux users troubleshoot_ any issues you might encounter. _**If you choose to use a PC or Linux machine, you will need to provide your own IT support.**_
