DS | Unit Project 3

## PROMPT

In this project, you will perform a logistic regression on the admissions data we have been working with projects 1 and 2. For more instructions, follow the questions included in the starter code.

**Goal:** Completed Jupyter notebook that includes basic modelling using logistic regression

---

## DELIVERABLES

- **Requirements:**
    - Create dummy variables
    - Calculate OR by hand
    - Complete a logistic regression using stats models and interpret your findings
    - Calculate predicted probabilities

- **Bonus:**
    - Plot the predicted probabilities
    - Brainstorm ways to improve your analysis

- **Submission:**
    - by 02/03

## EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Refine the Data

### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./project3-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score is a helpful gauge of whether you have met overall project goals, **specific scores are more important** since they will show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

## RESOURCES

### Dataset
We will be using the same dataset as UCLA's Logistic Regression in R tutorial to explore logistic regression in Python, as explained in [yhat's blog](http://blog.yhat.com/posts/logistic-regression-and-python.html). This is an excellent resource for using logistic regression and summary statistics to explore a relevant dataset. Our goal will be to identify the various factors that may influence admission into graduate school. It contains four variables: `admit`, `gre`, `gpa` and `rank`.

- `admit` is a binary variable. It indicates whether or not a candidate was admitted (`admit=1`) or not (`admit=0`)
- `gre` is GRE score
- `gpa` stands for Grade Point Average
- `rank` is the rank of an applicant's undergraduate alma mater, with 1 being the highest and 4 as the lowest

Dataset: [admissions.csv](../../../data/admissions.csv)

### Starter code
Review the questions in the [Jupyter Notebook](./starter/project3-starter.ipynb) provided.

### Suggestions for Getting Started
- Review logistic regression, odds ratios and probabilities from prior lessons.
- **Read the docs for Stats models.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a data scientist!
