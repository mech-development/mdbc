# ![](https://ga-dash.s3.amazonaws.com/production/assets/logo-9f88ae6c9c3871690e33280fcf557f33.png) Final Project, part 5: Final Presentation

## PROMPT

This is it! It is presentation time.

Whether during an interview or as part of a job, you will frequently have to present your findings to business partners and other interested parties - many of whom will not know anything about data science. That is why it is important to practice communicating your work clearly and effectively - for any audience.

Your goal is to create a 10-minute presentation that guides a non-technical audience through your problem, data, hypothesis, findings and results. You should already have the analytical work complete, so now it is time to clean up and clarify your findings.

Create a detailed 10-20 slide deck or interactive demo that explains your data, visualises your model, describes your approach, articulates strengths and weaknesses and presents specific recommendations. Plan for a 10-minute presentation with 1-2 minutes of Q&A; be prepared to explain and defend your model to an inquisitive audience!

**Goal:** A detailed 10-20 slide presentation deck that relates your data, model and findings to a non-technical audience.

## DELIVERABLES

### Final Presentation
**Requirements:**

- Show off your work to what would be a less technical, more business-oriented audience
- Summarise the work you have completed from earlier deliverables into a clean presentation, including:
    - Your project's background, problem and hypothesis
    - Descriptions of the dataset you used
    - Data exploration with summary and charts
    - An explanation of your model (for non-technical audiences)
    - Recommendations based on your findings
    - An appendix that includes all of your work and technical terminology
- Review next steps with your audience; what could you do beyond the scope of this course?

**Detailed Breakdown:**
A 10 to 20 slide deck consisting of:

- **1 Outline Slide**
    - What is your project about?
    - What is its history?
    - What relevant information is required for a colleague to jump in to understand your project?
- **2-3 Summary Slides** (including data and problem statement)
    - What were you trying to accomplish?
    - What steps did your project take?
    - Where did the data come from? What does a sample look like? Was there data you considered but decided to remove?
- **3-4 Modeling Insight Slides**
    - What is the visualisation explaining?
    - What do the x and y-axes mean?
    - How does the visualisation help either prove or disprove your work?
    - What caveats have to be explained to best understand it?
- **2-3 Modelling Approach Slides**
    - What was your model trying to optimise for? Why was it the right metric for optimisation?
    - What algorithm did you try? How does it work?
- **2-3 Results Slides**
    - What worked? What did not? Why?
- **1-2 Conclusion Slides**
    - What had the most impact on your work?
    - What can you confirm? What can you suggest? What is still to be determined?
- **1-2 Next Steps Slides**
    - What should this project do moving forward?
    - What would be the next two or three things you want to try? What impact might they have?
    - What might your conclusions enable others to do?

**Bonus:**

- An Acknowledgements Slide is always a good idea :)
- You might also include a Citations Slide, if necessary

**Submission:**

- by 06/04
- Format: Portable Document Format (.pdf)
- Location: Github's Class' repository (as per the previous Unit Projects)
- Presentation: Slide Show using student's notebook (check that your computer connects to GA's presentation resources)

## EVALUATION

Your project will be assessed using the following standards:

1. Present
2. Professional Development

### Rubric: [Click here for the complete rubric](./final-project-5-rubric.md).

Requirements for these standards will be assessed using the scale below:

    Score | Expectations
    ----- | ------------
    **0** | _Incomplete._
    **1** | _Does not meet expectations._
    **2** | _Meets expectations, good job!_
    **3** | _Exceeds expectations, you wonderful creature, you!_

While your total score may serve as a helpful gauge of whether you have met project goals, **specific standards scores are more important** since they can show you where to focus your efforts in the future!

## RESOURCES

### Starter Code

- Refer to the [presentation template](../part-02/project-design-template.md) as a blueprint for how to organise your work.

### Suggestions for Getting Started

- A quick outline (e.g. "what do I need" and "where can I find it") can help you prepare.
- Practice your presentation with a friend or family member! Outside feedback can help you identify gaps in your material.

### Specific Tips

- Limit the number of visuals and text on your slides for maximum clarity.
    - For instance, try not to use more than 2 visuals or 3-5 bullets per slide.
- Clean and informative presentations > Fancy Presentations!
- Keep your charts simple and make sure they are clearly labelled.

### Past Projects

- You can find previous General Assembly Presentations and Notebooks at the [GA Gallery](https://gallery.generalassemb.ly/DS?metro=)

### Additional Links

- Presentations from [PyData](http://www.slideshare.net/PyData/presentations)
- Presentations from [DataGotham](https://www.youtube.com/user/DataGotham), a shortly-ran data conference in NYC.
- [Seaborn](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/tutorial/aesthetics.html#scaling-plot-elements-with-plotting-context-and-set-context) has a handy easy way to set figures into a "talk" context, which blows up the text and makes it easier to read.
