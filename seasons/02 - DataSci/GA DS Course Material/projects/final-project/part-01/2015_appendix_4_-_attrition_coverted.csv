"(f) Prior to 2006, The University of Melbourne classified Study Abroad students as award. These were re-classified in 2006 to non-award, removing them from the scope of Retention calculation and affecting the rates.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

"(j) Attrition rate (normal calculation) is based on a match process using the students' StudentID. This gives a ""crude"" attrition rate, which identifies students that neither complete a course nor are retained the following year at the same institution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"(k) Attrition rate (adjusted calculation) is based on a match process using both the StudentID and CHESSN. This gives a more accurate attrition rate calculation, as it identifies students at either the same or a different higher education institution.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"In other words, if a student moves from one institution to another in the following year, he or she would be counted as retained in the adjusted attrition rate calculation, but attrited in the normal attrition rate calculation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Please note that the CHESSN is only required for Commonwealth Assisted students, which means the Adjusted Attrition Rate calculation using CHESSN will not be available for some students (namely non-Fee-HELP fee-paying students),",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
although these students can still be matched using their Student ID if they studied the following year at the same institution.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
