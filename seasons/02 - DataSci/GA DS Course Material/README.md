Welcome to GA's Part-Time Data Science Course (v 2.1)! We are building a global community of lifelong learners who are excited about using data to solve real world problems.

In this 10 week part-time course, students will use Python to explore datasets, build predictive models and communicate data driven insights. Specifically, students will:

- Learn the language of data scientists to contribute as a part of a greater team.
- Perform exploratory data analysis with powerful programmatic tools, Python and the command line.
- Build and refine basic machine learning models to predict patterns from datasets.
- Communicate data driven insights to a non-technical audience through visual storytelling.

Course materials for the [Data Science Part-Time Course](https://generalassemb.ly/education/data-science/melbourne) at General Assembly Melbourne from 31/01/17 to 06/04/17.
